### Task: Promise function

To complete this task, you should create a function that returns a `Promise`.

Create function `waitFor` which takes two parameters:
- `element` - DOM element;
- `eventName`, such as `click`, `input` and `blur`.
The function returns a `Promise` which should be resolved when `eventName` happened on `element`.
Function should return the notification message with text:
`It was ${eventName} on the element: ${element.nodeName}, id: ${element.id}.`
For example: `It was click on the element: INPUT, id: login.`

Create a function `printMessage` which takes one parameter `message` and adds to the DOM a <div> element with notification message above. Notification message should have class `message`.

All promises are called in `callPromise.js` file. Implement only `waitFor` and `printMessage` functions.

Hint: For convenience, several inputs and buttons have been added to the DOM. Use them for testing your function.
